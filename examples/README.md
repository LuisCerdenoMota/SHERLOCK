# Examples description
Two directories are presented down the examples dir:

* Programmatical: These are coding examples directly using the Sherlock class in Python code. We present several
possible configurations to be done by using the Sherlock class construction.

* Properties: The examples placed under this directory will assume that Sherlock will be launched by your local copy 
of the sherlock_runner.py file, which reads all the properties defined in the sherlock_user_properties.py file and
generates the proper Sherlock configurations for the run to be executed.
